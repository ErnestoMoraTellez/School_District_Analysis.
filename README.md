# School_District_Analysis.
## Overview of School District Analysis
Maria need to analyse data from the school district to provide insides for performance trends. We analyse data for budget and test scores in math and reading. We need to find trends on this information to help to make decitions for the school budgets and prioryties. We are using pandas to manupale date and show the information.

We have created to analysis, one with the hole information we get, and other excluding Thomas High School ninth grades, because Marie has been notified about academic dishonesty. So we made again the analisys without this infomration to see the influence and compare results.
