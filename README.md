# School_District_Analysis.

## Overview of School District Analysis
Maria need to analyse data from the school district to provide insides for performance trends. We analyse data for budget and test scores in math and reading. 
We have created two analysis, one with all information we got, and other excluding Thomas High School ninth grade, because Marie has been notified about academic dishonesty. So we made again the analisys without this infomration to see the influence and compare results.

## Purpose
We need to find trends on this information to help to make decitions for the school budgets and prioryties. We are using pandas to manipale data and show the information.

## School District Analysis results
- How is the district summary affected?

This is the district summary considering all the schools without cheating.

This is the district summary considering all the schools without Thomas High School (THS) ninth grade.

We can see that changing the scores of the ninth students in THS for math and reading affect more the  passing percentage the tests than the average of the scores. Specially the overall passing% has a bigger impact. We have a dicrease of 0.3%. This represents that 117 students less, didn't pass both exams compare to the first analysis. The reading and math passing percentage were also affected, but with less impact, 0.1% (49 students) and 0.2% (78) respectively.

The average of the math and reading scores is pretty much the same. Just the Math score decrease 0.1.

- How is the school summary affected?

This is the school summary with THS results.

This is the school summary without THS ninth grade results.
![School_summary_no_THS](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88845919/137596827-0ae894d5-337b-4cbc-aa2c-c0b6223bcd62.PNG)

We should notice that the only affected school is the THS. Because is the only one that we modify. Actually it has a vey high impact in the passing% for both exams. The math passing% decrease 26.36% (431 students), reading 27.65% (452 students), overall 25.87% (422 students). It's a very big share the one that was affected. And this made THS the school with the worst % of approval in math and reading topics. Not in the overall.
The average of the exams has very few impact, for math the score decrease 0.07 points and for reading it actually increase 0.05 points. This could mean that the 9th grade students probably need to focus more in reading. Beacuse the other grades has better scores in this topic and help the general average. However the impact or difference is very low.

- How does replacing the ninth grader's math and reading scores affect Thomas High Schoolâ€™s performance relative to the other schools?

This is the top five schools considering all information and the overall %.

This is the top five schools with out 9th grade students from THS.

Now, updating the information of THS with only the 10-12th grades results we can notice the following. 
In the above charts, we can see that the THS stills in 2nd place. Even the new overall % with this calculation (cosidering just 10-12th grade scores) decrease 0.32%. This impact wasn't enought to let Griffin High School get up to the second place.

- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  - Math and reading scores by grade
  
  This table shows complete data.

  This table shows data without THS ninth grade.

  As we know, we replace the scores of THS ninth gade, that's why it appears a nan value on the score section. So changing this values didn't affect the other scores or schools.
  
  
  - Scores by school spending
  
  This table shows complete data.

  As we can notice, theres no real change in the numbers. So we can add more decimals to see the real impact.
  
  This table shows complete data.

  This table shows data without THS ninth grade.

  Now we can see the impact in the range of $630-644. We change some scores of THS, and this school belongs to this specific range. That's why it's the only one affected, and    all numbers decrease.
  
  - Scores by school size
  
  This table shows complete data.

  Using directly more decimals. We can notice that the Medium schools results were affected. Almost all the results decrease beacuse of the change. Just the Average Reading Score increase. So, again, probably we can spend more in THS for reading clases.
  
  - Scores by school type
  This table shows complete data.

  We can notice that the group affected are the Charter schools. As we know THS belongs to this group. That's why the results change when we adjust the data of the students of THS.

## Summary

We changed the THS ninth grades scores to nan. This impact all the analysis in different ways.
Firts it affects the general results for THS. It impact the passing % directly.
Second, if we want to do the analysis for the whole district, we notice the decreasing in the passing % for math and reading.
Third, we can not know the average for this 9th group in THS, using grades analysis. Because we change the values.
Fourth, we saw an impact in different ways of grouping the information, by spending, size, type. This change affected the average and passing % of the $630-644 spending group, Medium schools group and Charter schools group. The explanation is that the THS belongs to this 3 groups.
